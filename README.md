Cactus Canyon
============

A P-ROC Project.  Written by a less-than-amateur.  Seriously, this is the first OOP I've ever done, so my code is probably garbage.  Try not to laugh.

I'm a plagarist
===============

A lot of code in this thing is blatantly lifted from the work of others. A LOT. Most of the working code in here can be attributed to Adam Preble, Gerry Stellenberg, Koen Heltzel, Jim Askey and others.  They're awesome. I'm a nub.

It's not all here
=================

There's other stuff involved.  The DMD graphics and sounds aren't in here.  So, this won't run as is.
